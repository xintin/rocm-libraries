Azure Pipeline Resolver Script
------------------------------
This script determines which Azure pipelines to run based on changed subtrees.
Using a predefined dependency map, the script resolves which projects need to be processed,
skipping those that will be covered by their dependencies.

Steps:
    1. Load a list of changed projects from a file.
    2. Consult a dependency map to determine transitive and direct dependencies.
    3. Identify projects that should be processed, excluding those handled by dependencies.
    4. Output the list of projects to be run, along with their Azure pipeline IDs.

Arguments:
    --subtree-file : Path to the file containing a newline-separated list of changed subtrees.

Outputs:
    Prints a newline-separated list of "project_name=definition_id" for the projects that need
    to be processed, where `definition_id` is the Azure pipeline ID associated with the project.

Example Usage:
    To determine which pipelines to run given the changed subtrees listed in a file:
        python azure_pipeline_resolver.py --subtree-file changed_subtrees.txt
